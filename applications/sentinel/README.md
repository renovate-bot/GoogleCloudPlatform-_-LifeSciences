### Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for unit testing the API services and routes.

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Docker Deployment

The application is containerized using a multi-stage Docker build that serves the React frontend via the FastAPI backend.

### Build and Run

1. **Build the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t sentinel .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:

   * **Run with AI Studio (API Key)**

      ```bash
      docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env sentinel
      ```

   * **Run with Agent Platform**

      You need to provide your Google Cloud credentials to the container.

      ```bash
      # Authenticate locally first
      gcloud auth application-default login

      # Run container with mounted credentials and environment file
      # We use --user to ensure the container can read the mounted credentials
      docker run -p 8080:8080 \
      --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      -v ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/app/gcp_creds.json \
      -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/gcp_creds.json \
      --env-file .env \
      sentinel
      ```



## Cloud Run Deployment

Deploying Sentinel to Google Cloud Run is the recommended way to run the application in a production-like environment.

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- APIs enabled: Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Agent Platform, IAP, Cloud Resource Manager, Cloud Storage
- GCS Bucket for storing image features

### Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to build and deploy the Sentinel application using Cloud Run and Artifact Registry.

1. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
   export REGION=us-central1
   export BUCKET_NAME=sentinel-images-$PROJECT_ID
   
   gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
   export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format="value(projectNumber)")
   ```

2. **Enable APIs**:
   Enable the necessary Google Cloud APIs.
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable \
     run.googleapis.com \
     artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
     aiplatform.googleapis.com \
     iap.googleapis.com \
     storage.googleapis.com \
     cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
   ```

3. **Create Artifact Registry Repository**:
   Create a Docker repository to store your container images.
   ```bash
   gcloud artifacts repositories create docker-repo \
     --repository-format=docker \
     --location=$REGION \
     --description="Docker repository"
   ```

4. **Build and Push Image**:
   Build the container image locally and push it to Artifact Registry.
   ```bash
   # Configure Docker authentication
   gcloud auth configure-docker $REGION-docker.pkg.dev

   # Build and Tag
   export IMAGE_URI=$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/docker-repo/sentinel:latest
   docker build -t $IMAGE_URI .

   # Push to Artifact Registry
   docker push $IMAGE_URI
   ```

5. **Create a GCS Bucket**:
   Sentinel requires a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store image features for analysis.
   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets create gs://$BUCKET_NAME --location=$REGION
   ```

6. **Create Service Account**:
   Create a dedicated Service Account for the application.
   ```bash
   export SA_NAME=sentinel-sa
   export SA_EMAIL=$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

   gcloud iam service-accounts create $SA_NAME --display-name="Sentinel Application Service Account"
   ```

7. **Grant Storage Permissions**:
   Grant the Service Account access to the GCS Bucket for reading and writing images.
   ```bash
   gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$BUCKET_NAME \
     --member="serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL" \
     --role="roles/storage.objectUser"
   ```

8. **Grant Agent Platform Permissions**:
   Grant the Service Account access to Agent Platform for using the Gemini API.
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
     --member="serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL" \
     --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
   ```

9. **Deploy with IAP**:
   Deploy the service with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) enabled for secure access, using the custom Service Account.
   ```bash
   gcloud beta run deploy sentinel \
     --image $IMAGE_URI \
     --region $REGION \
     --no-allow-unauthenticated \
     --iap \
     --service-account $SA_EMAIL \
     --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true,GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$PROJECT_ID,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global,GCS_BUCKET_NAME=$BUCKET_NAME"
   ```

10. **Configure IAP Access**:
    Grant the IAP Service Agent permission to invoke your Cloud Run service.
    ```bash
    gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding sentinel \
      --region $REGION \
      --member="serviceAccount:service-$PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-iap.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
      --role="roles/run.invoker"
    ```

11. **Grant User Access**:
    Authorize users or groups to access the application behind IAP.
      ```bash
      gcloud beta iap web add-iam-policy-binding \
      --resource-type=cloud-run \
      --service=sentinel \
      --region=$REGION \
      --member="user:[USER_EMAIL]" \
      --role="roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor"
      ```
      *Replace `[USER_EMAIL]` with the email address of the user you want to grant access to (e.g., `user@example.com`). You can also use `--member="group:[GROUP_EMAIL]"` for groups.*
      
      **Note:** You must add authorized users (including yourself) to access the application URL.
